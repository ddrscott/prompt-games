# Prompt Games

Games generated by AI with clever system prompts.

## Pong

In './pong-v4/', create a simple JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Canvas app that is a one player game of PONG.
The left paddle is controlled by the player, following where the mouse goes.
The right paddle is controlled by a simple AI algorithm, which slowly moves the paddle toward the ball at every frame, with some probability of error.
Make the canvas a 640 x 480 black rectangle and center it in the app.
Scale canvas to the viewport while maintaining its aspect ratio.
Make the paddles 100px long, yellow and the ball small and red.
Make sure to render the paddles and name them so they can controlled in javascript.
Implement the collision detection and scoring as well.
Every time the ball bounces off a paddle, the ball should move faster.
It is meant to run in Chrome browser, so dont use anything that is not supported by Chrome, and don't use the import and export keywords.
